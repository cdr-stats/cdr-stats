CDR-Stats is a CDR viewer for Asterisk/Freeswitch Call Data Records. It allows you to 
interrogate your CDR to provide reports and statistics via a simple to 
use, yet powerful, web interface.

It is based on the Django Python Framework which enables the building 
of clean, maintainable web applications, and encourages rapid 
development with clean and pragmatic design.

Star2Billing S.L. is the company behind the development of CDR-Stats, and 
was originally formed to provide a revenue stream to support the popular 
open source A2Billing Telecom Switch and Billing System by providing 
professional support, installation and consultancy services.
